# ConformationalCoordPropagation
Propagation of Conformational Coordinates Across Angular Space.

We have used the Matlab version for this paper:
Maji et al. 2020."Propagation of Conformational Coordinates Across Angular Space in Mapping the Continuum of States from Cryo-EM Data by Manifold Embedding". DOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.9b01115.

We are providing here with the python code which is part of the ManifoldEM sofrware, since it contains a cleaner and updated version of the original Matlab implementation.
